Tasks related to CC support:

- [x] allow explicit inclusion of paths
- [x] ensure all error output goes to stderr
- [x] allow specifying a formatter on the cmd line
- [x] implement a CC results formatter for JSON
- [x] bash wrapper script to :
      1. copy /code to a writable dir
      1. run `ctags` on that dir
      1. read config.json & then exec unused
- [x] dockerfile build process (use dual-container trick with stack-musl)
- [ ] Track line numbers of defs as part, include in CC output
- [ ] BUG: see note below about console resets, etc. These are still getting
      sent within CLI runs, which causes issues. Need to either disable all that
      junk intelligently based on TTY/TERM, or turn it off with an explicit flag.
- [ ] Finish up CC formatter: write readup contents, etc.


Other things:
* my `resultsFormatter` impl in App is... not elegant. Improve that?
* local testing with new flags shows that the console resets/text changes are
  happening in undesirable ways. Might not be a practical problem within an
  engine (no tty), but bears attention
